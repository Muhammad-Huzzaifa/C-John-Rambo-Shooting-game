To run the second .cpp file (with sfml and file handeling), you first need to include the sfml library in your project, then add any two sounds named (Game_sound1 & Game_sound2), remember that these two audios are must of wave type, ogg type, and flac type. No other type of audio is included using sfml in c++. And secondly you need to include the HIGH_SCORE.txt file or simply download it from above.
